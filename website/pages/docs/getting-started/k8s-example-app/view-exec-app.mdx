# Exec Into the App Container

In order to provide a simpler operations experience for deployments, Waypoint allows you to execute commands against your deployments.
You can execute these commands via the `waypoint exec` command. Let's enter a shell prompt on our deployment.

```bash
waypoint exec /bin/bash
```

Since we're in our deployment directory, you'll note that Waypoint automatically executes aginst the currently deployed application.

From within, we can validate that this is the actual application by listing out the directory hosting our ReactJS compiled files.

```bash
ls /usr/share/nginx/html
```

```shell
/ # ls /usr/share/nginx/html
50x.html                                               index.html                                             precache-manifest.5cce187c0f4137cb3c7b6cabe154741b.js
