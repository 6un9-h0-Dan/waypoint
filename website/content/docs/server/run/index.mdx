# Waypoint Server Installation

The recommended way to install the server is using the
[`waypoint install`](/commands/install) command.
This command will install a server into Docker, Kubernetes, or Nomad,
bootstrap the server, and configure your local CLI to access that server.
It is a single command to get up and running with Waypoint.

You can also run and configure the server manually using the
[`waypoint server run`](#TODO) command. This is meant for more advanced
users who want to run Waypoint in a platform that the `install` command doesn't support
or to fine-tune the configuration of the server.

-> **Note:** Only _one_ Waypoint server needs to be installed and run
for any group of people using Waypoint together. If you are a day-to-day
user of Waypoint with a group of people you may not need to install a server.
In this case, see the documentation on
[connecting to a server](/docs/server#connecting).

## Upgrading

For details on upgrading the server, please see the
[general Waypoint upgrade documentation](/docs/upgrading).
