# Waypoint URL Service

Applications deployed with Waypoint will receive a public `waypoint.run` URL
with a valid TLS certificate automatically generated via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
This URL can be used to quickly view your deployed applications and share your
applications with others. A Waypoint URL looks like:
`outspoken-laughing-duck.waypoint.run`.

The URL service is a free, public service hosted by HashiCorp. We have open
sourced the URL service so you can also self-host it if you choose. We apply
some limits to the public service to prevent abuse.

The URL service must be enabled on the Waypoint server and your applications
must use the [Waypoint entrypoint](/docs/entrypoint) for this functionality
to work.

~> **Warning:** The URLs generated by Waypoint are publicly routable. If you
do not want the public to view your application, disable the URL for your
app or keep the URL secret.

-> **Development Only!** Waypoint URLs do not currently support production-level traffic and should be used for development purposes only.

## App URLs

When you first deploy an application, the Waypoint server registers it a unique URL per-application. Waypoint also registers unique URLs for each [workspace](/docs/workspaces).

By default, Waypoint routes an app's URL only to released deployments.

### Deployment URLs

You can route an app's URL to a specific deployment, even if
that deployment is not released. Waypoint applies a deployment version number to your application each time that you deploy it.

For example, if your app has been deployed three times, Waypoint will associate the version of `v3` to the app.

You can route directly to a version of the deployed app by appending the version number to the deployment URL. For example, to route directly to the v2 deployment of the app, append the version number to the URL by using this format: `--v2`.

Here's an example URL that routes to v2 of the app's deployment: `outspoken-laughing-duck--v2.waypoint.run`
(note the **double hyphen**).

## Configuration

The URL service is configured in two places: the server and by project.

**Server Configuration**

The Waypoint server configuration specifies whether the URL service is enabled and what address is used for the service.

The URL service is **enabled by default** and points to the public Waypoint URL service. If you want to use the URL service for any of your app's deployed with Waypoint, you must enable the service on the server.

-> To use the hosted Waypoint URL Service, you must accept the Waypoint Terms of Service and Privacy Policy by specifying the "-accept-tos" flag when you install Waypoint with `waypoint install`. To opt-out of the using the hosted URL service, you must manually run the Waypoint server. To configure the URL service on the server, use the `waypoint server` command.

** Project and App-Level Configuration **

You can also configure whether the URL service is enabled for each project and app.

A project or app can opt-out of a generated URL. This has no effect if the
URL service is disabled at the server level. Reference
[`waypoint.hcl` URL stanza](/docs/waypoint-hcl/url) for details.

## Protocols

The URL service today only supports HTTP services. We automatically provision
and serve a valid TLS certificate and will reject any insecure connections.
In the future we will support other protocols such as general TCP.

## Limits

We apply the following limits to the URL service to prevent abuse:

- **Requests per second.** There is a req/s limitation applied
  per URL to prevent excessive traffic. When this limit is reached
  connections will be rejected.

- **Bandwidth.** There is a bandwidth limitation applied to all URLs
  to prevent using the URL service for large file transfers. When this
  limit is reached, bandwidth will be throttled.

These limits cannot be raised today. In the future, we plan on providing
account registration to raise limits. HashiCorp has no intention of profiting from
this service, but we may charge for increased limits in the future to offset
costs. A free tier will always remain.

## Self-Hosting

You may choose to self-host the Waypoint URL service if you'd like. Doing this
will allow you to use a custom domain and may increase security for you. As a
warning, note that the Waypoint URL service wasn't built with ease of deployment
in mind and also requires additional infrastructure resources such as databases.
Self-hosting is advanced and is not generally recommended.

The Waypoint URL service is open source and requires two separate components
along with their supporting infrastructure. You may find installation instructions
in the README files of the services.

~> Internal beta: TODO. We need to open source these and link here.
