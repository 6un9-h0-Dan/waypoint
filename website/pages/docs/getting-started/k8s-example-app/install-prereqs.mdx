## Examples Repository

This walkthrough will use an [example ReactJS application](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples/tree/master/reactjs) to show how to build, deploy, and release using Waypoint. This example is part
of the [waypoint-samples](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples) repository. You will need a local clone of this repository in order to leverage this guide.

Clone and enter the samples repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
cd waypoint-examples/reactjs
```

We will also copy over a sample waypoint.hcl file from the examples repository to help you get started quickly.

```bash
cp ../kubernetes/nodejs/waypoint.hcl .
```

## A Kubernetes Environment

Waypoint supports current Kubernetes distributions across multiple environments and is unopinionated about which distribution you should use. You'll also need to ensure you have your KubeConfig set under the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to allow access to the cluster.
