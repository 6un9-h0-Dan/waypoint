# Exec Into the App Container

Now that we've got a deployment, let's take a look at `waypoint exec`. This allows the ability to run commands
in the context of the most recent deployment. Typcially this is used for running database migrations and debugging
but can be used for any purpose.

Let's have a look at what processes the example ruby app is running:

```shell
$ waypoint exec ps ax
# Connected to 01EJCQVA40CG5FC6EGW5PZFC5N
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 ?        Ssl    0:00 /bin/wpceb /cnb/lifecycle/launcher
   14 ?        Sl     0:02 puma 3.11.2 (tcp://0.0.0.0:3000) [workspace]
   22 ?        Sl     0:00 puma: cluster worker 0: 14 [workspace]
   24 ?        Sl     0:00 puma: cluster worker 1: 14 [workspace]
   49 pts/0    Rs+    0:00 /bin/ps ax

```
