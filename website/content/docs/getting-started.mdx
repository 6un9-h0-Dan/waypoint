# Get Started with Waypoint

It only takes a few minutes to get started with Waypoint on your local
development environment.

Afterwards, go in-depth with tutorials for AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and
Nomad at [HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/waypoint).

This quick start example uses Docker, either on Linux or with [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Windows and macOS.

## Install Waypoint

[Download](/downloads) the Waypoint binary and install it to your system. The
easiest way to install it is to use our official signed packages for Homebrew,
`apt`, `yum`, and other package managers.

## Install the server

Start the Docker Desktop application.

Install the Waypoint server to Docker with the `install` command. The
`-accept-tos` flag is required to use the `waypoint.run` URL publishing service.

```shell-session
waypoint install --platform=docker -accept-tos
```

## Initialize Waypoint

Clone the git repository with Waypoint application examples, or [download the
code](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples) directly from GitHub.

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

Navigate to the `docker/nodejs` directory.

```shell-session
cd docker/nodejs
```

All the code you need is provided in this directory, including a `waypoint.hcl`
configuration file that will deploy the application to Docker.

Run `init` to set up the project.

```shell-session
waypoint init
```

## Deploy

Now, run `waypoint up` to build, deploy, and release the application.

```shell-session
waypoint up
```

It may take a minute or two. Visit the URL shown in the output. You will see a
NodeJS application running on your local Docker Desktop instance.

## Change

Change any part of the file at `docker/nodejs/views/pages/index.ejs`. Run `up`
again to deploy a new version of the application.

```shell-session
waypoint up
```

## Destroy

When you are done, run `destroy` to remove the application from Docker.

```shell-session
waypoint destroy
```

## Next Steps

You have used Waypoint to build, deploy, and release a NodeJS application to Docker.
