# Walkthrough Summary

At this point we have completed the walkthrough for Deploying a NodeJS Application on Nomad with Waypoint.

In this guide, you accomplished the following tasks:

- Initializing an Application against Waypoint
- Deploying our application with the `pack` plugin
- Iterating on the application itself by changing text
- Redeployed our application
- Executing commands with `waypoint exec`
- Viewing log data with `waypoint logs`

From here, we suggest you try one of the other Getting Started guides, or explore deploying
your own applications and contributing to the [Waypoint examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples)!
