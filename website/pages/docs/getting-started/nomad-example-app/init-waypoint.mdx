# Initailizing Waypoint for Your App

Before you can deploy your application, you must let Waypoint know about its configuration. This is done through the `waypoint.hcl`
file that you copied over in the previous steps. We can inspect this `waypoint.hcl` with the following command

```
cat waypoint.hcl
```

Which should output the following:

```shell
project = "example-nodejs"

  app "example-nodejs" {

    build {
      use "pack" {}
      registry {
          use "docker" {
            image = "waypoint-example.local/nodejs-example"
            tag = "latest"
          }
      }
  }

    deploy {
      use "nomad" {
        datacenter = "dc1"
      }
    }

  }
```

The `build` clause defines how Waypoint will build the app. The `pack` option tells Waypoint to use the most relevant Cloud Native
Buildpack to build the application. This application is a ReactJS based application, so ultimately NodeJS Buildpacks will be used.

The `deploy` clause defines where Waypoint will deploy the app. In our case, this is going to Nomad. We have a specific Nomad
`datacenter`configured here.

Since we're working with ReactJS, and our sample `waypoint.hcl` was for NodejS, we need to make a couple of small adjustments to
our application name and add an environment variable. **Note: You also want to update your docker image and location to a location
that you have access to, if this is running on an external Kubernetes cluster**.

```shell
app "reactjs" {
    build {
      use "pack" {}
      registry {
        use "docker" {
          image = "waypoint.local/sample/reactjs"
          tag = "latest"
        }
       }
    }

   deploy {
      use "nomad" {
          datacenter="dc1"
          static_environment = { "CI"="true" }
      }
    }
}
```

In summary

- Change `app` from `app "nodejs"` to `app "reactjs"`
- Add `static_environment = { "CI"="true" }` to the `deploy` stanza
- Update the `registry` stanza with the correct docker image repository for your deployments

With these configurations in place, execute the following command in order to initialize Waypoint with this configuration.

```bash
$ waypoint init
```
