# Update and Redeploy the App

One of the most powerful parts of Waypoint is its ability to iterate on deployments and quickly redeploy the application with your changes in place.

Open the following file in your preferred development editor:

`app/views/welcome/index.erb`.

In the `p` block below the `H1`, update the text to whatever you like and save the file.

```shell
...
    <h1>Welcome to Waypoint: <%= @host %></h1>
    <p> <!-- Edit the text in this block -->
      Congrats on deploying a ruby app using Waypoint. From here you can edit this project and continue to use it to develop your app, if you so wish.
    </p>
...
```

Back in the Terminal, redeploy the application with your new and improved text.

```shell
$ waypoint up
```

Waypoint has now redeployed your application to Docker for Desktop, including using the same preview URL that it previously created when it first deployed your app.
