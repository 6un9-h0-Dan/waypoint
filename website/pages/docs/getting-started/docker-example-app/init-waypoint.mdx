# Initailizing Waypoint for Your App

Before you can deploy your application, you must let Waypoint know about its configuration.

## Waypoint Configuration - waypoint.hcl

The `waypoint.hcl` configuration file provides the instructions to Waypoint for how to build, deploy, and release your application. When you initialize Waypoint for your application, Waypoint will first look for a `waypoint.hcl` file in that directory. If it cannot find the configuration, Waypoint will inspect the application and create a starter `waypoint.hcl` file that you can then customize for your deployment workflow.

**Todo:** Add link here for waypoint.hcl snippets/config

## Initialize Waypoint for the Example App

The remainder of this walkthrough will use an [example application](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples/tree/master/ruby) to show how to initialize an app and then build, deploy, and release it with Waypoint.

This example app is written in Ruby and [includes a `waypoint.hcl` file](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples/blob/master/ruby/waypoint.hcl) that uses Docker to deploy the application.

```shell
project = "example-ruby"

app "example-ruby" {
  labels = {
    "service" = "example-ruby",
    "env" = "dev"
  }

  build {
    use "pack" {}
  }

  deploy {
    use "docker" {}
  }
}
```

The `build` clause defines how Waypoint will build the app. The `pack` option tells Waypoint to use the most relevant Cloud Native buildpack to build the application. Since the example app is authored with Ruby, Waypoint will use the Ruby buildpack.

The `deploy` clause defines how Waypoint will deploy the app. The `docker` option tells Waypoint to deploy the application to Docker for Desktop.

Initalize the application with Waypoint by running the following in the Terminal. With this command, you do not need to have the application's source code stored on your computer.

```bash
$ waypoint init (TODO - instruction for pointing to sample app)
```

**Todo:** Add output for successful app init.
