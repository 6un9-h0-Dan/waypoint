# Walkthrough Summary

At this point we have completed the walkthrough for deploying a NodeJS application on Nomad with Waypoint using the Waypoint deployment workflow..

In this guide, you accomplished the following tasks:

- Installed Waypoint and initialed an app
- Built, deployed, and released the app with the Waypoint workflow
- Made a change to the app and then redeployed it
- Ran commands on the app with `waypoint exec`
- Viewed the app's log data
- Accessed the Waypoint web UI

From here, we suggest you try one of the other Getting Started guides like [deploying an application to Kubernetes](/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app), or explore deploying
your own applications and contributing to the [Waypoint examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples)!
