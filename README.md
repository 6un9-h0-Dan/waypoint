## Overview

HashiCorp Waypoint is an easy to use tool that standardizes application build, deploy, and release workflows as code. It focuses on delivering applications in a consistent and repeatable way, reducing time to deploy and allowing developers to ship applications across common developer platforms.

Waypoint uses:

- One configuration file, one common language, as code
- An end-to-end workflow to build, deploy, and release for applications

You can also use Waypoint to validate deployments across distinct environments through common execution and logging.
