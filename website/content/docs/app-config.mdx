# Application Configuration

Waypoint can configure your application via environment variables
via the CLI using `waypoint config`.

Applications often take configuration such as database URLs, ports to
listen on, etc. in the form of environment variables. Using `waypoint config`,
you can set these variables and Waypoint will automatically make them
available to your application.

This functionality requires the [Waypoint entrypoint](/docs/entrypoint).

## Setting Configuration

Configuration can be set using `waypoint config set`.

```shell-session
$ waypoint config set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://example.com:5432"
```

This will make the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable present with the
given value for all deployed applications. For already-deployed applications,
Waypoint will [restart running applications](#application-restart-behavior)
when configuration changes.

### Project Scope

`waypoint config set` will set variables by default scoped to the _project_.
This means that all applications within your project will have the environment
variable set.

### Application Scope

You may use the `-app` flag to scope a variable to a specific application.
For this scope, only a specific application in the project will have the
configuration set.

```shell-session
$ waypoint config set -app web PORT=8080
```

## Unsetting Configuration

To delete a configuration variable, set it to the empty string.

## Application Restart Behavior

Waypoint will automatically restart your running applications whenever
a configuration change is detected for that application. Waypoint restarts
your application with the following steps:

1. The `SIGTERM` signal is sent to your application process. This signal
   can be trapped to perform last minute cleanup and shutdown.

2. Waypoint will wait up to 30 seconds for your application to gracefully exit.

3. After 30 seconds, Waypoint will send the `SIGKILL` signal to your
   application process group. This will kill the application process as well
   as any subprocesses it may have started. This signal is not able to be trapped
   and your application will be killed immediately.
