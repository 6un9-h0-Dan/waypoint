# Install Waypoint

-> Review the [prerequisites walkthrough](/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app/install-prereqs) before installing
Waypoint. You will use the `Ruby` application in the examples for this walkthrough.

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release applications. This is
all available from a single binary.

## Download the Binary

To install Waypoint, find the appropriate package on [the releases site](https://go.hashi.co/waypoint-beta-binaries)
for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package. Waypoint runs as a single binary named `waypoint`. Any
other files in the package can be safely removed and Waypoint will still function.

To make the binary available from anywhere on your system, you can either
copy it into `/usr/local/bin` or add it to a different directory in your `PATH`. For
instructions on how to do that, see [Editing your Path](#path).

```
$ cp ~/Downloads/waypoint /usr/local/bin
```

You can validate the installation by running `waypoint`:

```
$ waypoint
Usage: waypoint [-version] [-help] [-autocomplete-(un)install] <command> [args]

Common commands:
    release      Release a deployment.
    up           Perform the build, deploy, and release steps for the app.
    build        Build a new versioned artifact from source.
...
```

## Create Kubernetes Secret for Server Image

-> Due to Waypoint currently being in a private beta, you need to provide
authentication details for Kubernetes to access the container image that
contains the Waypoint binary for running the server. Once public, this step will not be required.

In order to provide your Kubernetes cluster access to the Waypoint container image during
the private beta, you need to create a Kubernetes secret that contains authentication information
for the GitHub packages repository that hosts the image.

First, you need to [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitHub.

Then, save the token to a file named `TOKEN.txt`. We will read this token when creating the Kubernetes secret. Ensure `kubectl`
is configured to interact with the correct Kubernetes cluster, and then run the following command:

```
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry github --docker-server=docker.pkg.github.com --docker-username=GITHUBUSERNAME --docker-password="$(< TOKEN.txt)" --docker-email=GITHUBEMAIL
```

When you run Waypoint install, it defaults to using an image hosted on the GitHub Docker registry.

## Install the Waypoint Server

In the Waypoint directory, install the Waypoint server to Docker for Desktop on your computer. This
allows you to view the user interface, collaborate on deployments, and more.

```shell
 $ waypoint install -platform=kubernetes
```

You may also install the server to a Kubernetes cluster or a [Nomad cluster](https://nomadproject.io). To learn
more about Kubernetes, see the getting started
guide for [deploying an app to Kubernetes](/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app/install-waypoint). This walkthrough
shows you how to deploy the server and an example app to Kubernetes.

## About the Server Workflow

When you deploy your app with Waypoint, your computer (the Waypoint client) connects
to the Waypoint server to initiate the Waypoint workflow. The client then registers
itself as a runner, allowing Waypoint to run builds on it.

When the build is completed, Waypoint sends the build artifacts, such as a Docker file,
to the artifact registry of your choice. With Waypoint, multiple clients can concurrently
connect to a single server to deploy and release applications.

## Editing your Path (Optional) ((#path))

If you do not want to copy Waypoint into a file already in your path, you
can edit your `PATH` to include a directory that contains the Waypoint binary.
This allows you to use the `waypoint` command without having to include the
full directory path to the binary.

See what is in your current `$PATH` definition.

```shell
$ echo $PATH
```

If you do not have an entry for the Waypoint binary, add the following line to your shell profile:

`export PATH=$PATH:my-directory-path-to-waypoint-binary`

For example: `export PATH=$PATH:~/enlistments/waypoint`

- To determine your shell, run `echo $SHELL`
- If using Bash, use `nano ~/.bash_profile` to edit your Bash profile.
- If using ZSH, use `nano ~/.zshrc` to edit your ZSH profile.
