# Waypoint Get Started

The Waypoint Getting Started guides will help you become familiar with Waypoint, and learn how you can deploy applications with minimal friction through Waypoint.

The tutorials are intended to be completed sequentially, as each one builds upon knowledge from the previous tutorial.
You will learn how to install Waypoint, deploy an application, and remove applications through Waypoint.
Most importantly, you will learn how to get an application from development to a target environment by using a single file, `waypoint.hcl`, and a single command `waypoint up`.
