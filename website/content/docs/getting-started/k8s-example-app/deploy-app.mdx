# Building and Deploying

### Running Waypoint Up


This application is configured to use Cloud Native Buildpacks to detect the type of application running and to launch it within Kubernetes. Because Waypoint uses the applicable buildpack to create the Dockerfile, you do not need to create the file yourself.

Once Waypoint completes a build, it stores the artifacts in either a local or remote registry.

The `registry` clause in the `waypoint.hcl` file specifies where to store the app's artifacts. If the `registry` clause is not present, Waypoint will default to using the local docker instance to store the app's artifacts.

For this example application, Waypoint will store the image in a remote Docker repository after the app is built.

We can now deploy the application to Kubernetes by running `waypoint up`.

```shell-session
waypoint up
```

Waypoint will show the progressive status of the build, deploy, and release steps in the Terminal output. As part of the deployment workflow, Waypoint creates a preview URL for your application.

-> The preview URL is optional and can be disabled in the Waypoint server configuration.

Waypoint will show the result of your deployment in the Terminal, along with your specific preview URL.

```shell
The deploy was successful! A Waypoint deployment URL is shown below. This
can be used internally to check your deployment and is not meant for external
traffic. You can manage this hostname using "waypoint hostname."

           URL: https://instantly-worthy-shrew.alpha.waypoint.run
Deployment URL: https://instantly-worthy-shrew--v1.alpha.waypoint.run
```

~> Waypoint creates the preview URL on a HashiCorp service. Because this preview URL is connected to your application and where it has been deployed, the URL will only show your application when it is running. In this walkthrough, this means that Docker for Desktop and the container for the deployed example Ruby application must both be running for the URL to render your application.
