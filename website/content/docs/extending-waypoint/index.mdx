# How Waypoint Plugins Work

Plugins in Waypoint are separate binaries which communicate with the Waypoint application, the plugin communicates
using gRPC and while it is theoretically possible to build a plugin in any language supported by the gRPC framework.
We recommend that the developers leverage the [Waypoint SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-plugin-sdk) for Go to
peform this task.

In this section you will find reference documentation for creating plugins, if you would like to jump straight in and
start creating a plugin, please checkout the [Creating Waypoint Plugins Guide](/docs/extending-waypoint/example-plugin).

## Concepts

Conceptually Waypoint Plugins can be defined using the following terms:

- `Plugin` - A Plugin is a compiled binary containing one or more Components which are executed by the Waypoint application
- `Component` - A Component handles part of the Waypoint application lifecycle, i.e Build, Deploy, etc. Components are created by implementing
  various interfaces
- `Interface` - An interface implements specific behaviour in a Component, i.e. Configurable, ReleaseManager
- `Output Value` - A Protocol Buffer serializable type which can be passed between components.
