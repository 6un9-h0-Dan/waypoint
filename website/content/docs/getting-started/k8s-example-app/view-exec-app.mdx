# Exec Into the App Container

Now that you have deployed your app, you can use `waypoint exec` to run commands in the context of the most recent deployment. Typically, `waypoint exec` will be used for running database migrations and debugging; however, you can use it for any purpose.

For example, you can use the command to open a shell prompt.

```shell-session
$ waypoint exec /bin/bash
```

Since you are in the deployment directory, you will see that Waypoint automatically executes against the currently deployed application.

From within, we can validate that this is the actual application by listing out the directory hosting the app's compiled files.

```shell-session
$ cd /
$ ls
```

You should see an output that contains the file structure for the current deployment.
