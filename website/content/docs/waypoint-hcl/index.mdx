# Project Configuration: `waypoint.hcl`

The `waypoint.hcl` file is used to configure each Waypoint project. It defines
how Waypoint build, deploys, and releases a project. The `waypoint.hcl` file is
written in [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) or JSON, allowing both human
and machine friendly formats.

Waypoint expects one `waypoint.hcl` per [project](/docs/glossary#project) or
version control repository. The `waypoint.hcl` file is supposed to be committed
to version control. This allows multiple team members to share the same Waypoint
behavior and also provides a history of change in how an application is deployed.
