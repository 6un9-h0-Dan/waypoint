# Waypoint Architecture

Waypoint has many different components that interact with each other.
This page documents all of these components: what they do, how they
work with each other, when they're required, etc.

## High-Level Overview

The diagram below shows a typical single-platform deployment of Waypoint.

-> Note: some of the components are optional by sacrificing functionality.
It is possible to operate Waypoint without entrypoints, but you'll lose
all [entrypoint-required functionality](/docs/entrypoint#functionality).
