# Prerequisites

## Examples Repository

This walkthrough uses an example NodeJS application to show you how to build, deploy and release using Waypoint.

This example app is part
of the [Waypoint Examples applications](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples). You will need a local clone of this repository on your computer to complete this walkthrough.

Clone the Waypoint Examples repository and navigate to the Kubernetes NodeJS example directory.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
cd waypoint-examples/kubernetes/nodejs
```

## A Kubernetes Environment

You can use any current Kubernetes distribution with Waypoint. Set your KubeConfig set with the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to allow access to the cluster.

<!-- Need to add details about how to set kubeconfig and example -->
