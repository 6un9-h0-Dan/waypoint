# Top-Level

This page describes the top-level fields and stanzas that can be set
in a `waypoint.hcl` file. The "top-level" refers to the fact that these
are the first fields and stanzas used in a Waypoint project configuration
and aren't nested in some other configuration.

```hcl
project = "my-website"

app "frontend" {
  # ...
}

# ...
```

## Parameters

### Required

- `app` <code>([app][app])</code> - One or more applications to build, deploy,
  and release with Waypoint.

- `project` `(string)` - The name of the project. This should be unique
  for the Waypoint server and must not be changed later. This is used to
  organize information on the server.

~> **Warning: the project name can not be changed.** Changing the project
name is not currently supported. If you change the name, the history,
deployments, etc. of the previous project name will not be migrated or destroyed.
A future version of Waypoint will enable renaming projects.

### Optional

- `plugin` <code>([plugin][plugin])</code> - External plugins that may be
  used in this configuration. Plugins are implicitly defined with
  [`use`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) stanzas so this is only required if you
  need to additionally configure a plugin.
