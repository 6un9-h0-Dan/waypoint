Now that you have deployed your app, you can use `waypoint exec` to run commands in the context of the most recent deployment. Typically, `waypoint exec` will be used for running database migrations and debugging; however, you can use it for any purpose.

For example, you can use the command to open a shell prompt.

```bash
waypoint exec /bin/bash
```

Since you are in the deployment directory, you will see that Waypoint automatically executes against the currently deployed application.

From within, we can validate that this is the actual application by listing out the directory hosting the app's compiled files.

```bash
ls /usr/share/nginx/html
```

You should see an output that contains the app's static files that were compiled.
