# Install Waypoint

<!-- Make this a partial -->

-> Review the [prerequisites for this walkthrough](docs/getting-started/nomad-example-app/install-prereqs) before installing Waypoint.
You will use the `ReactJS` application in the examples for this walkthrough.

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release applications.

## Download the Precompiled Binary

To install Waypoint, find the appropriate package for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package into any directory. Waypoint runs as a single binary named `waypoint`. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Waypoint will still function.

Finally, make sure that the waypoint binary is available on your [PATH](#path).

### How to Add Waypoint to Your Path ((#path))

Add Waypoint to your `$PATH` to use the `waypoint` command without having to include the full directory path to the binary.

See what is in your current `$PATH` definition.

```shell
$ echo $PATH
```

If you do not have an entry for the Waypoint binary, add the following line to your shell profile:

`export PATH=$PATH:my-directory-path-to-waypoint-binary`

For example: `export PATH=$PATH:~/enlistments/waypoint`

- To determine your shell, run `echo $SHELL`
- If using Bash, use `nano ~/.bash_profile` to edit your Bash profile.
- If using ZSH, use `nano ~/.zshrc` to edit your ZSH profile.

## Install the Waypoint Server

Once the Waypoint binary location has been added to your path, execute the following command to install the Waypoint server on Nomad.

```shell
 $ waypoint install --platform="nomad" --nomad-dc="dc1"
```

### Workflow

When you deploy your app with Waypoint, your computer (the Waypoint client) connects to the Waypoint server to initiate the Waypoint workflow. The client then registers itself as a runner, allowing Waypoint to run builds on it.

When the build is completed, Waypoint sends the build artifacts, such as a Docker image, to the artifact registry of your choice. With Waypoint, multiple clients can concurrently connect to a single server to deploy and release applications.
