# Waypoint Server

Waypoint utilizes a server for storing operation history and coordinating
with the [entrypoint](/docs/entrypoint) to enable functionality such as
logs, exec, and more. The server is expected to be always-running and
accessible by both your deployments as well as any users of Waypoint.

-> **Note:** Only _one_ Waypoint server needs to be installed and run
for any group of people using Waypoint together. If you are a day-to-day
user of Waypoint with a group of people you may be able to skip this section.

We've made it as easy as possible to install and run a Waypoint server
using a single command: [`waypoint install`](/commands/install). This
automatically installs and configures the UI and local CLI to access the
server and lets you start working with Waypoint immediately.

## Installation

The recommended way to install the server is using the
[`waypoint install`](/commands/install) command.
This command will install a server into Docker, Kubernetes, or Nomad,
bootstrap the server, and configure your local CLI to access that server.
It is a single command to get up and running with Waypoint.

You can also run and configure the server manually using the
[`waypoint server run`](#TODO) command. This is meant for more advanced
users who want to run Waypoint in a platform that the `install` command doesn't support
or to fine-tune the configuration of the server.

### Upgrading

For details on upgrading the server, please see the
[general Waypoint upgrade documentation](/docs/upgrading).

## Security

The Waypoint server must be secured accordingly. This section will outline
the risks (and explicit non-risks) of a Waypoint server and mitigations the
server may have towards these. This is not an explicit threat model; we plan on
refining and publishing a threat model in the near future.

The Waypoint server supports TLS for all inbound connections, and we recommend
always using this. The Waypoint server also requires authentication for all
connections, and multiple authentication tokens can be created and revoked.
Authentication is not optional.

The Waypoint server doesn't yet support fine-grained authorization. Anyone
with an authentication token can access any part of the system. Note though
that the Waypoint server _does not_ execute operations (as noted later). One
exception to this is the [entrypoint](/docs/entrypoint), which uses a special
authentication token that can only access entrypoint-related APIs.

The state stored by Waypoint in-memory and on-disk is not encrypted. We
cannot always detect tampering of the data. The state stored is primarily
metadata that does not impact runtime behavior of Waypoint, with the exception
of [application configuration](/docs/app-config).

The Waypoint server _does not_ require access to credentials or platforms
for builds, deploys, etc. The Waypoint server _does not_ run these operations.
These operations are coordinated with the server but executed locally in
the CLI. The server does store metadata about operations such as time of
execution, logs, etc.

The Waypoint server maintains long-running inbound connections from
any [entrypoints](/docs/entrypoint). These can be used to trigger an
[exec session](/docs/exec) if exec is enabled.

The Waypoint server stores any static [application configuration](/docs/app-config).
This may contain secrets.
