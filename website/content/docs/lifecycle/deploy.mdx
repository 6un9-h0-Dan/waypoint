# Deploy

A deploy takes a previously
[built artifact](/docs/lifecycle/build)
and stages it onto the target
deployment platform. The target deployment platform is pluggable and can be
Docker, Kubernetes, Nomad, EC2, and more.

"Stage" in this context means that the application should be ready to receive
traffic, but is not yet open to public traffic. For example, the application
should not be added to the load balancer, DNS should not be updated, etc.
While it is staged, the deployment is accessible via the
[deployment URL](/docs/url#deployment-urls) or other internal means.

-> **Note:** Not all platforms support the concept of "staging" a deployment or this
behavior may not be desirable. Waypoint does not enforce this requirement
and some deployment plugins may not support it.

A deploy is triggered during a `waypoint up` or using the dedicated
`waypoint deploy` command.

## Configuration

The deploy is configured using the `deploy` stanza within an `app`:

```
app "my-app" {
  deploy {
    use "kubernetes" {}
  }
}
```

## Automatic Release

By default, `waypoint deploy` automatically performs a
[release](/docs/lifecycle/deploy).

This is because this is often the most expected behavior of a deploy
since traditionally deploy and release were inseparable. We consider
separating deploy and release a best practice so we encourage
Waypoint users to disable this behavior as soon as they're comfortable.

This behavior can be disabled by using the `-release=false` flag
with `waypoint deploy`:

```
$ waypoint deploy -release=false
...
```

-> A future Waypoint version will allow this to be disabled in the project
configuration file.
