# Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of Waypoint. The goal
of this document is to give anyone interested in contributing to Waypoint
a high-level overview of how Waypoint works. This tries to stay high level
to guide to the right area of Waypoint, but stops short of explaining in detail
how something might work since its easy for that to get out of sync with the
codebase. The recommended usage for this doc is to use it to hone in on a
specific part of Waypoint, then study the code there for specifics.
