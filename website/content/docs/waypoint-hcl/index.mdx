# Project Configuration: `waypoint.hcl`

The `waypoint.hcl` file is used to configure each Waypoint project. It defines
how Waypoint build, deploys, and releases a project. The `waypoint.hcl` file is
written in [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) or JSON, allowing both human
and machine friendly formats.

Waypoint expects one `waypoint.hcl` per [project](/docs/glossary#project) or
version control repository. The `waypoint.hcl` file is supposed to be committed
to version control. This allows multiple team members to share the same Waypoint
behavior and also provides a history of change in how an application is deployed.

Begin with the [top-level documentation](/docs/waypoint-hcl/root) if you're new
to Waypoint configuration.

## File Location

The `waypoint.hcl` file is typically placed at the root of a version control
repository. Multiple applications are defined using [`app`][app] stanzas and
may live in subdirectories of the project.

When executing the `waypoint` CLI, it'll search for the `waypoint.hcl` file
in the current directory followed by each subsequent parent directory.

## Stanzas and Parameters

The configuration is documented in terms of "stanzas" and "parameters". All
of the available stanzas for a Waypoint configuration are linked in the left
side navigation.

A "stanza" is the term used to describe a parameter in a Waypoint configuration
that opens and closes with braces `{ }` and may contain more configuration.
A "parameter" is the term used to describe any configuration within a stanza.

In the example below, `app` and `build` are stanzas. All elements are
"parameters" but of different elements: the `build` is a parameter of an `app`,
`app` is a parameter of the top-level, etc.

```hcl
app {
  path = "./src"

  build {
    # ...
  }
}
```
