# Install Waypoint

<!-- Make this a partial -->

-> Review this walkthrough's [prerequisites](docs/getting-started/nomad-example-app/install-prereqs) before installing Waypoint.

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release applications. This functionality is all available from a single binary.

## Download the Binary

To install Waypoint, find the appropriate package on [the releases site](https://go.hashi.co/waypoint-beta-binaries)
for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package. Waypoint runs as a single binary named `waypoint`. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Waypoint will still function.

To make the binary available from anywhere on your system, you can either copy it into `/usr/local/bin` or add it to a different directory in your `PATH`. For instructions on how to do that, see [Editing your Path](#path).

```shell-session
$ cp ~/Downloads/waypoint /usr/local/bin
```

Validate the installation by running the `waypoint` command.

```
$ waypoint
Usage: waypoint [-version] [-help] [-autocomplete-(un)install] <command> [args]

Common commands:
    release      Release a deployment.
    up           Perform the build, deploy, and release steps for the app.
    build        Build a new versioned artifact from source.
...
```

## Pull the Latest Waypoint Server Image

<!-- Get instructions for this from eng team -->

## Install the Waypoint Server

In this step we will install the Waypoint server onto Nomad. This allows you to view the user interface, collaborate on deployments, and more.

Waypoint automatically creates the Nomad job for the Waypoint server. As this is behind an authenticated image repository currently, you should pull the latest Waypoint server image, and tag it locally by running the following commands:

```shell-session
$ docker login docker.pkg.github.com
$ docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/alpha:latest
$ docker tag docker.pkg.github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/alpha:latest waypoint/server:local
```

This step will not be required once the beta completes.

After tagging the image locally, run the following command to install the Waypoint server.

```shell-session
 $ waypoint install -server-image=waypoint/server:local -platform=nomad --nomad-dc=dc1 -accept-tos
```

@include "getting-started/about-server.mdx"
