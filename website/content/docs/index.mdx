# Waypoint

This documentation provides reference and introduction to the functionality provided by Waypoint and Waypoint plugins, as well as an overview of some of the internals of how Waypoint works.

## Get Started with Waypoint

All of these walkthroughs use example applications and are designed to help you try out Waypoint as simply and quickly as possible.

### Start Here

[Deploy an example app with Docker](https://waypointproject.io/docs/getting-started/docker-example-app)

If you're new to Waypoint, we recommend you start with the Docker walkthrough. This walkthrough will take about 5 minutes and uses an example app and Docker Desktop to illustrate the Waypoint workflow.

Once you have mastered the basics of Waypoint, try deploying an example app to Kubernets or Nomad.
