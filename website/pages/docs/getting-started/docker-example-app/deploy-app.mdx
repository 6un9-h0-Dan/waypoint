# Deploy Your App

### Deploying the Example Application

This application is configured to use Cloud Native Buildpacks to detect the type of application running and to launch it within Docker. As a result, the application has no Dockerfile because the language specific buildpack handles that.
The resulting Docker image is stored on the local Docker instance.

Deploy the application to Docker.

```bash
waypoint up
```

Waypoint will show the progressive status of the build, deploy, and release steps in the Terminal output. As part of the deployment workflow, Waypoint creates a preview URL for your application.

-> The preview URL is optional and can be disabled for in the Waypoint server configuration.

Waypoint will show the result of your deployment in the Terminal, along with your specific preview URL.

```
The deploy was successful! A Waypoint deployment URL is shown below. This
can be used internally to check your deployment and is not meant for external
traffic. You can manage this hostname using "waypoint hostname."

           URL: https://instantly-worthy-shrew.alpha.waypoint.run
Deployment URL: https://instantly-worthy-shrew--01EJ0F2VYWTNTYJ6FNFNTY44G9.alpha.waypoint.run
```

~> For the initial release, Waypoint creates the preview URL on a HashiCorp service. Because this preview URL is connected to your application and where it has been deployed, the URL will only show your application when it is running. In this walkthrough, this means that Docker for Desktop and the container for the deployed example Ruby application must both be running for the URL to render your application.
