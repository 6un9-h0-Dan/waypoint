# Install Waypoint

## Precompiled Binaries

To install the precompiled binary, download the appropriate package for your system. Waypoint is currently packaged as a zip file.

Once the zip is downloaded, unzip it into any directory. The `waypoint` binary inside is all that is necessary to run Waypoint (or `waypoint.exe` for Windows). No additional files are required to run Waypoint.

Copy the binary to anywhere on your system. If you intend to access it from the command-line, make sure to place it somewhere on your [PATH](#path).

Continue on to try using Waypoint to deploy an application.

## Add Waypoint to Your Path ((#path))

Add Waypoint to your \$PATH to use the `waypoint` command
without having to include the full directory path to the binary.

Run `echo $PATH` to see what is in your current \$PATH definition. If you do not have an entry for the Waypoint binary, add the following line to your shell profile:
`export PATH=$PATH:my-directory-path-to-waypoint-binary`
For example: `export PATH=$PATH:~/enlistments/waypoint`

- To determine your shell, run `echo $SHELL`
- If using Bash, use `nano ~/.bash_profile` to edit your Bash profile.
- If using ZSH, use `nano ~/.zshrc` to edit your ZSH profile.
