# Install Waypoint

<!-- Make this a partial -->

Waypoint uses both a client and a server to build, deploy, and release applications.

## Download the Precompiled Binary

To install Waypoint, find the appropriate package for your system and download it as a zip archive.

After downloading Waypoint, unzip the package into any directory. Waypoint runs as a single binary named `waypoint`. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Waypoint will still function.

Finally, make sure that the waypoint binary is available on your [PATH](#path).

## Install the Waypoint Server

In the Waypoint directory, install the Waypoint server to Docker Desktop on your computer.

```shell
 waypoint install -platform=docker
```

You may also install the server to a Kubernetes cluster. To learn more, see the getting started guide for [deploying an app to Kubernetes](docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app/install-waypoint) on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This walkthrough shows you how to deploy the server and an example app to Kubernetes.

When you deploy your app with Waypoint, your computer (the Waypoint client) connects to the Waypoint server to initiate the Waypoint workflow. Waypoint runs builds on the client computer and then sends the build artifacts, such as a Docker file, to the artifact registry of your choice. With Waypoint, multiple clients can concurrently connect to a single server to deploy and release applications.

### How to Add Waypoint to Your Path ((#path))

Add Waypoint to your `$PATH` to use the `waypoint` command without having to include the full directory path to the binary.

See what is in your current `$PATH` definition.

```shell
$ echo $PATH
```

If you do not have an entry for the Waypoint binary, add the following line to your shell profile:

`export PATH=$PATH:my-directory-path-to-waypoint-binary`

For example: `export PATH=$PATH:~/enlistments/waypoint`

- To determine your shell, run `echo $SHELL`
- If using Bash, use `nano ~/.bash_profile` to edit your Bash profile.
- If using ZSH, use `nano ~/.zshrc` to edit your ZSH profile.
