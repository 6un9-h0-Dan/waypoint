# Update and Redeploy the Application

One of the most powerful workflows that Waypoint enables is the ability to continuously iterate and redeploy changes to you applications in a consistent way. Let's demonstrate
this by updating a few of the values within the application.

Using your favorite IDE, edit the following file `src/App.js` file within the ReactJS directory. We've included a new image in this directory for your that we'll replace the default ReactJS image with.

- On line 2 of the code, replace `./logo.svg` with `./hashi.png` (or another image if you want to use one, just place it in the public directory).
- On line 11 - Edit this line to include a catchy phrase. I prefer a quote from your favorite movie, but hey, live your dream. This is about you as the application developer!

Save your file, and re-run the `waypoint up` command

```bash
waypoint up
```

Access the preview URL and observe that your application changes have been reflected in the new version of the deployment.
