# How Waypoint Plugins Work

Plugins in Waypoint are separate binaries which communicate with the Waypoint application, the plugin communicates
using gRPC and while it is theoretically possible to build a plugin in any language supported by the gRPC framework.
We recommend that the developers leverage the [Waypoint SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-plugin-sdk).
Leveraging the SDK developers can create plugins which cover the full Waypoint lifecycle.
