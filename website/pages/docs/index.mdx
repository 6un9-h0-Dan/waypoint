# HashiCorp Waypoint

## Where to Start

To learn about how to use Waypoint and more about how it works, use either of the two walkthroughs in this Getting Started guide. Both walkthroughs use example applications.

The Docker walkthrough runs on your computer and gives you a very quick overview of how Waypoint works. If you would like to see how Waypoint deploys apps to Kubernetes, try the EKS walkthrough.

## Deploy your first app to Docker Desktop

- Time required: About 10 minutes
- Prerequisites: Docker Desktop
- [Try Waypoint now](/docs/getting-started/docker-example-app)

## Deploy an example app to Kubernetes on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

- Time required: Between 20 and 30 minutes
- Prerequisites: AWS account with a running Kubernetes cluster in EKS
- [Try Waypoint now](docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app)
