```release-note:feature
core: Introduce RunTriggers to Waypoint Server and CLI. Triggers can be configured
ahead of time to execute lifecycle operations on demand through the Waypoint API.
Currently, the gRPC API is only supported, but in the future an HTTP endpoint
will be added to be used within CI.
