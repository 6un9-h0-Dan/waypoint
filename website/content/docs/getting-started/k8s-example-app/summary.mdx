# Walkthrough Summary

At this point we have completed the walkthrough for deploying a NodeJS application on Kubernetes using the Waypoint deployment workflow.

In this guide, you accomplished the following tasks:

- Installed Waypoint and initialed an app
- Built, deployed, and released the app with the Waypoint workflow
- Made a change to the app and then redeployed it
- Ran commands on the app with `waypoint exec`
- Viewed the app's log data
- Accessed the Waypoint web UI

Next, try [deploying an application to Nomad](/docs/getting-started/nomad-example-app).
