# Prerequisites

## Examples Repository

This walkthrough uses an example NodeJS application to show you how to build, deploy and release using Waypoint.

This example app is part
of the [Waypoint Examples applications](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples). You will need a local clone of this repository on your computer to complete this walkthrough.

Clone the Waypoint Examples repository and navigate to the Nomad NodeJS example directory.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git

$ cd waypoint-examples/nomad/nodejs
```

## A Nomad Environment

Waypoint supports Nomad both as a location for running the Waypoint server and for running application workloads.

To get started with Nomad, review the [HashiCorp Learn Nomad tutorials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad).

You will also want to export the `NOMAD_ADDR` environment variable. Waypoint will call this variable for interacting with the Nomad
environment.
