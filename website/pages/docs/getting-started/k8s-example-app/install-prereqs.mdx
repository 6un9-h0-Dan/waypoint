## Examples Repository

You will need a local clone the source code repository for the [Waypoint Examples applications](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples) on your computer. You will use one of these apps to learn how to use Waypoint to deploy an app, update it, and then redeploy.

Clone the repository.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git
```

## A Kubernetes Environment

Waypoint supports current Kubernetes distributions across multiple environments and is unopinionated about which distribution you should use. You'll also need to ensure you have your KubeConfig set under the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to allow access to the cluster.
